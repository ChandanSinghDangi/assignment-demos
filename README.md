# Frontend Demos

Welcome to my *Frontend Demos* repository!  

All the projects in this repository are *mini assignments or demo projects* that were given to me by various companies and startups as part of their *hiring process. The purpose of these assignments was to **practice real-world tasks, improve my skills, and qualify for interviews, with the goal of securing an **internship, placement, or full-time job*.  

> âš¡ Note: These projects are mainly for *learning and practice purposes*. They showcase my progress in front-end development and my ability to implement tasks provided by companies during the hiring process.

## Projects Overview

- Mini-projects built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and other front-end tools.  
- Each project demonstrates *practical skills* like API integration, routing, state management, and UI/UX implementation.
- Some projects were built following tutorials, while others were *original implementations based on assignment requirements*.
